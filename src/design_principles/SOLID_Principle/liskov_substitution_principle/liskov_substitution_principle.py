SOLID Principles: Open Close Principle
LSP definition states that,If S is a subtype of T,
then objects of type T in a program may be replaced
with objects of type S without altering any
of the desirable properties of that program.

1. Preconditions cannot be strengthened in a subtype
2. Postconditions cannot be weakened in a subtype.
3. Invariants of the supertype must be preserved in a subtype.
