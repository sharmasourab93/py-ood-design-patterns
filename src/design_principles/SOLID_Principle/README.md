###What are Software Design Principles?
Software design principles represent a set guidelines that help us avoid having a bad design.
Reference to Robert Martin's
 
``` Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns and Practises.```

There are 3 important characteristics of a bad design that can be avoided. 
1. **Rigidity** - It is hard to change because every change affects too many parts.
2. **Fragility** - When you make a change, unexpected parts of the system break.
3. **Immobility** - It is hard to reuse in another application because it cannot be disentangled from current application.
