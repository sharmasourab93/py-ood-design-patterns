# Design patterns

Each design systematically names, explains and evaluates an important and recurring design in object oriented systems.

Design patterns make it easier to reuse successful designs and architecture.
### What are design patterns? 
Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution to that problem a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice. 

In general, a pattern has four essential elements
* Pattern Name <br/>
    *Naming a pattern increases design vocabulary*<br/>
    
* Problem <br/>
    *When to apply a pattern explains the problem and the context*<br/>
    
* Solution <br/>
    *Elements that make up the design, their relationships, responsibilities and or collborations*<br/>
* Consequence <br/>
    *Consequences are results and trade-offs of applying the pattern*<br/>
    
A design pattern names, abstracts and identifies the key aspects of a common design structure that make it useful for creating a reusable object oriented design. The designstructure that make it useful for creating a reusable object oriented design. The design pattern identifies the participating classes and instances, their roles and collaborations and the distribution of responsibilities.


###Why use Design Patterns?
Motivations for making, learning & utilizing design patterns are many fold. 

* They are a way to name complex abstract concepts to enable discussion & teaching. 
* They make communication within teams faster. 

Bad Patterns that tend to be commonly invested because they seem logical on the first glance are often called *anti-patterns*. Inorder for something to justly be called an anti-pattern, it needs to be commonly re-invented and there needs to be a pattern for the same problem which solves it better. 

### Design Patterns In Python
Traditionally, design patterns have been classified into three main categories:  
         * Creational  
         * Structural <br/> 
         * Behavioural

There are other categories, like architectural or concurring patterns.
